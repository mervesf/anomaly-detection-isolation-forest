# anomaly-detection-isolation-forest
I created an Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection. After detecting anomalies in my data set, I performed normalization. To evaluate the performance of my model, I calculated the mean absolute error between the other data set where anomalies were detected with high accuracy and the data set where I used the Isolation Forest model.
